This is a senior design project focusing on researching the differences between a quantum machine learning model and a classical model.  This basis of this project is directly comparing Grover's algorithm (quantum) with the A* algorithm (classical).

Currently to run this, the groversAlogrithm.py file checks the sample placeholder data in rockyou_hashed.csv.  It goes throught 4 steps: <ol><li>Superposition: Initializes qubits in a superposition state that gives each qubit an equal opportunity for each possible state. <li>Oracle: The oracle alters the phases in its attempt to single out the correct answer.<li>Diffusion/amplification: After the oracle, a series of gates and operations are performed to increase the likelihood that the state will collapse to the correct answer.<li>Measurement: Measurement is where we look at the state to see what the result is.</ol>
